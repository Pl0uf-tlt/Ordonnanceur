The goal of this project is to create a scheduler for fictional processes. The scheduler works with priorities.

The Processus.py module contain the process class wich defines what a fictional process is. 

The Ordo.py file contain the main fonctions (triTpsArr, triPrio, triPrioExe, ordo, affichageOrdo, affichageOrdo2) and some tests on known test sets.
